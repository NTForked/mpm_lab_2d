# mpm_lab_2d
Material point method in 2D. Based off the paper from Stomakhin et al.

This code uses a hyperelastic model coupled with plastic deformation determined by the principal stretches. The code currently only includes an explicit time integration scheme and uses a cubic B-Spline. The code also is implemented in two-dimensions but an extension to three-dimensions is in process. Many of the details can be found in my MS Thesis report, feel free to contact me if you'd like a copy.
